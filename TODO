* Use different fragment programs for transformed surfaces and
  non-transformed surfaces.

* Allow the fragment filters to be applied to mask surfaces
  and not only source surfaces. The filter system and the fragment
  programs are design to work both with source and mask surfaces,
  so this should be really easy. Most work will be to validate that
  it works correct for all cases.

* Add low-pass sub-pixel filters for HW accelerated color balancing 
  of per-component alpha masks.

* Gamma correction. Software multi-sampling using stencil bits
  can easily be gamma corrected without any performance penelty.
  Gammma correction for the add_trapezoids and add_triangles might
  be harder. The above mentioned sub-pixel filters should include
  gamma correction and I should probably also add a gamma correction filter for
  alpha-masks and per-component alpha-masks without color
  balancing.

* GL_MESA_pack_invert support.

* Retained-mode rendering.

* WGL (Windows GL) backend.

* Mesa-solo backend.
