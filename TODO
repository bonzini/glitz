* Switch to new trapezoid type. Add x_offset and y_offset to
  glitz_composite_trapezoids, glitz_composite_triangles and similars.

* Add glitz_add_trapezoids, glitz_add_triangles...

* Fix so that projective transformations actually work.

* Implement the new convolution and the new gradient filters.
  (Current filters are broken!)

* Add low-pass sub-pixel filters for HW accelerated color balancing 
  of per-component alpha masks (possibly with gamma correction).

* GL_MESA_pack_invert support.

* Retained-mode rendering.

* WGL (Windows GL) backend.

* Mesa-solo backend.
