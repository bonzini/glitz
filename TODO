* Allow the fragment filters to be applied to mask surfaces
  and not only source surfaces. The filter system and the fragment
  programs are design to work both with source and mask surfaces,
  so this should be really easy. Most of the work will be to validate
  that it works correct in all cases.

* Add low-pass sub-pixel filters for HW accelerated color balancing 
  of per-component alpha masks.

* Gamma correction. Software multi-sampling using stencil bits
  can easily be gamma corrected without any performance penelty.
  The above mentioned sub-pixel filters should include gamma
  correction and I should probably also add a gamma correction
  filter for alpha-masks and per-component alpha-masks without color
  balancing.

* Improve AGL backend (proc address lookups).

* WGL (Windows GL) backend.

* Mesa-solo backend.
